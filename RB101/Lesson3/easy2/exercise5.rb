# show an easier way to write this array:

flinstones = ["Fred", "Barney", "Wilma", "Betty", "BamBam", "Pebbles" ]

flinstones = %w(Fred Barney Wilma Betty BamBam Pebbles)

#NOTES: I got the right answer in terms of the format for the array shortcur %w(). The only problem was that I didnt assign it to the flinstones variable. 

# lesson here is we still need to apply the array shortcut to the variable name. Also, we dont need to use ''
