# back in the stone age (before CSS) we used spaces to align things on the screen. if we had a table of Flinststone family members that was forty characters in width, how could we easily center that title above the table with spaces? 

title = "flinstone Family Members"

puts title.center(40)

#again, very stright forward solution, using the center metod we can center the string. This method receives the number of characters as argument.
