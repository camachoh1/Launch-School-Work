# progammatically determine if 42 lies between 10 and 100. 

puts (10..100).cover?(42)

#outputs true. 

#notes: 

# range is an object and also a class. Since it is a class it has it's own methods. Such as cover?

#this method returns true if an object is found between the beginning and the end of the range.
