# write a one-liner to count the number of lower-case 't' characters in the following string:

statement = "The Flinstones Rock!"

puts statement.count('t')

#This one was pretty straight forward, I just needed to use the count method which receives a value as argument and it returns the number of times the argument ( in this case lowercase 't') appears in the string.
